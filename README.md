Replacement PCB for the PET 2001N Keyboard

In an Effort to restore an Commodore PET 2001N to working condition, I need to replace the Keyboard PCB, as the original one is cracked and has multiple holes. I suspect the Trunk style top Half was dropped with something underneath the keyboard.

The goal is to recreate the original PCB as closely as possible, but the main problem with that is, that the original PCB is a single layer PCB, with printed/glued on bridges and a bare FR4 backside, wich woukd be possible to manufacture, but only at an astronomical cost for single boards. For that reason I have chosen to do a simple 2 Layer board, with the bridges traced on the Bottom Layer. With the huge spacings of the original board, this can be manufactured by any modern boardhouse for an affordable price.
